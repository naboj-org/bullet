# Code editors

I personally recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), because it
has excellent support for Django framework. It is a paid software, but you can easily
get [student licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) for free.

Good results can be also achieved by using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
which is an open-source code editor from Microsoft.

## PyCharm setup

Setting up PyCharm project is pretty simple:

1. Open project folder in PyCharm
2. Right-click on `bullet` folder (the one with `manage.py`) and choose Mark Directory as → Sources Root.
3. Open Settings, select Languages & Frameworks → Django
    - Enable Django support
    - Django project root: select folder with `manage.py`
    - Settings: `bullet/settings/development.py`

## VS Code setup

I recommend using [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension,
however I don't have much experience using VS Code.

**Somebody could extend this section.**
