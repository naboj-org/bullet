# Results

The [“Results” page](/admin/results/) of the administration interface allows you to view public and admin results
and announce results.

## Viewing Results

You can view results for every venue you have access to.

* **Public results:** Shows the results in the same way they are shown to the public. This includes the freeze that
happens some time before the competition ends.
* **Admin results:** Shows the real results at this time. This means that admin results are not frozen and always show
current data.

Links on the results page will lead to the country-language combination you last accessed.

## Announcing Results

You can access the result announcement for a selected venue / country. The system will show you a simple slideshow-like
interface.

By default, the team is hidden, so you don’t accidentally show the winners, press `H` or the eye button in
the bottom-right corner to show the team.

The slideshow can be controlled using the buttons in the bottom-right corner, or by using keyboard shortcuts:

* `arrow up` / `space` shows team with rank N-1
* `arrow down` / `backspace` shows team with rank N+1
* `H` hides or unhides the team.

The currently selected rank is also shown in the bottom-right corner, even when the team is currently hidden.

## How are the results sorted?

The results are sorted based on the competition rules:

1. The team with more solved problems should be placed higher in the results.
2. The team that solved a higher problem should be placed higher in the results.
3. The team that submitted their last problem sooner should be placed higher in the results.
